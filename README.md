📊 Sales Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard providing comprehensive insights into company sales performance across product categories, brands, supervisors, and geographic regions for the financial year 2024–25.

📝 Short Description / Purpose
The Sales Dashboard is designed to offer a real-time, visual overview of total sales, profits, costs, and transactions. It enables business managers and analysts to track supervisor productivity, category-wise sales trends, brand performance, and regional distribution, helping to drive informed, strategic decision-making.

🧰 Tech Stack
This dashboard was developed using the following technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main tool for building interactive reports and dashboards.

⚙️ Power Query – Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For custom measures like total profit, total quantity, and brand-wise sales percentages.

🧩 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between tables for accurate cross-filtering and aggregations.

📁 File Format – Built using .pbix (Power BI project) and exported as .png for presentation.

📂 Data Source
Source: Internal company sales database (fictional data).

Contains sales records by product category, brand, supervisor, and Indian state.

Additional columns include sales amount, cost, profit, quantity sold, and transaction count.

Geo-mapping enables regional analysis.
